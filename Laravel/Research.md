## Request Lifecycle

### Introduction

When using any tool in the "real world", you feel more confident if you understand how that tool works. Application development is no different. When you understand how your development tools function, you feel more comfortable and confident using them.

The goal of this document is to give you a good, high-level overview of how the Laravel framework works. By getting to know the overall framework better, everything feels less "magical" and you will be more confident building your applications. If you don't understand all of the terms right away, don't lose heart! Just try to get a basic grasp of what is going on, and your knowledge will grow as you explore other sections of the documentation.

## Routing

### Basic Routing

The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a closure, providing a very simple and expressive method of defining routes and behavior without complicated routing configuration files:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/greeting', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```

## Facades

Throughout the Laravel documentation, you will see examples of code that interacts with Laravel's features via "facades". Facades provide a "static" interface to classes that are available in the application's service container. Laravel ships with many facades which provide access to almost all of Laravel's features.

Laravel facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more testability and flexibility than traditional static methods. 

It's perfectly fine if you don't totally understand how facades workâ€”just go with the flow and continue learning about Laravel.
