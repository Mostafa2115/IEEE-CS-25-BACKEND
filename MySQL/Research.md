<h3>what is the database and why does it exist ?</h3>
<hr>
A database is information that's set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.

Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. They collect information on people, places or things. This information is gathered in one place so it can be observed and analyzed. Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.

Business, government and scientific fields use databases for data storage, analysis and management. Organizations use the data stored in databases to make informed business decisions.
