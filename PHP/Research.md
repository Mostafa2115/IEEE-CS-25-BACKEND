# PHP | Types of Errors

- **Parse error or Syntax Error**: It is the type of error done by the programmer in the source code of the program. The syntax error is caught by the compiler. After fixing the syntax error the compiler compile the code and execute it. Parse errors can be caused dues to unclosed quotes, missing or Extra parentheses, Unclosed braces, Missing semicolon etc
- **Fatal Error**: It is the type of error where PHP compiler understand the PHP code but it recognizes an undeclared function. This means that function is called without the definition of function.
- **Warning Errors** : The main reason of warning errors are including a missing file. This means that the PHP function call the missing file.
- **Notice Error**: It is similar to warning error. It means that the program contains something wrong but it allows the execution of script.

# PHP echo and print Statements

- **echo** and **print** are both used to output data to the screen.
- They are similar, but there are some differences:

  - `echo` has **no return value**, while `print` has a **return value of 1**, so it can be used in expressions.
  - `echo` can take **multiple parameters** (though this is rarely used), while `print` can take only **one argument**.
  - `echo` is **marginally faster** than `print`.
